            What is WMM (WiFi Multimedia)?<br />
            <br />
            WMM maintains the priority of audio, video and voice, over other applications which are less time critical.<br />
            <br />
            Using QoS (Quality of Service) Wi-Fi Multi-Media (WMM) ensures that the applications that require better throughput and<br />
            performance, are inserted in queues with higher priority. For example, video and audio applications are given higher priority<br />
            over applications such as FTP.<br />
            <br />
            In this way, in a phone conversation, you are less likely to hear delays. Watching video, you are more likely to see smooth action.<br />
            This delays other network traffic of a less critical nature - such as downloading large files - where a small  time delay is acceptable.<br />

            WMM defines the following four queues, in decreasing order of priority:<br />
            <br />
            Voice.The highest priority queue with minimum delay, which makes it ideal for applications such as voice over IP(VoIP) and streaming media.<br />
            <br />
            Video. The second highest priority queue with low delay is given to this queue. Video applications are routed to this queue.<br />
            <br />
            Best Effort. The medium priority queue with medium delay is given to this queue. Most standard IP applications use this queue.<br />
            <br />
            Background. Low priority queue with high throughput. Applications, such as FTP, that are not time-sensitive,  but require high throughput,<br />
            can use this queue.<br />
            <br />
            WMM does not provide guaranteed throughput.WMM is a subset of the IEEE 802.11e standard.<br />
            To function correctly, wireless clients need to support WMM.All  NETGEAR wireless products support WMM.<br />
            <br />
            From Netgear: Examples being WC7520 Controller, and WNDAPxxx Access points.<br />
            WMM differs from the advanced QoS feature in other products - used by system administrators - in that QoS allows high or low priorities<br />
            to be assigned to any traffic, not just to audio, video, or voice.<br />
            <br />
            Power Save:<br />
            <br />
            The Wi-Fi Alliance has added Power Save Certification to the WMM specification.<br />
            Power Save uses mechanisms from 802.11e and legacy 802.11,to save power (for battery powered equipment) and fine-tune power consumption.<br />
            This feature of WMM to save power might cause disconnects under certain conditions.<br />
